# OpenShade
OpenShade is a tool to modify HLSL shaders in Prepar3D v4, based on the known PTA previously used in P3D v3.

## Getting started
To use OpenShade, simply download the latest release [here](https://github.com/LB767/OpenShade/releases).

The software is still in active development, so expect bugs and feel free to report them here.

## FAQ
- Is this PTA for v4?

No. OpenShade comes with the same base tweaks as the old free version of PTA and uses the same preset file format, simply to retain backwards compatibility as long as possible.
Any changes that were made from PTA v3 to v4 are not present in OpenShade and with time both softwares will evolve each in their own direction.

- Can I use the latest PTA v4 preset files with this?

Yes. The file format is the same, for now. But bear in mind that not all tweaks may work correctly since OpenShade is based on an older version of PTA.
